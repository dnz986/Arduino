# Arduino

My Arduino Projects

Libraries:
	- EtherShield: https://github.com/thiseldo/EtherShield - Works with my current setup of an Arduino Uno with an Ethernet Shield 1.1 based on the ENC28J60 chip. 
	Couldn't get the suggested EtherCard library to work with my boards. Thanks to https://github.com/fr00ller/EtherShield for getting this to work with Arduino Ide 1.6.
	Copying this here so that I still can use it.
	
EtherVent:
	- Web server that controlls two relays; one for power the other for the speed of the fan
	- simple json api for exposing current state
